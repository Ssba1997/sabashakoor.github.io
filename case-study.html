  <h1>🚲 Citi Bike Dashboard</h1>
  <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, Streamlit, Tableau, NOAA API</p>

  <h2>🧩 Project Overview</h2>
  <p>This dashboard explores bike usage patterns in NYC during 2022. The goal was to identify seasonal trends, popular start stations, and optimize bike distribution strategy using weather data integration.</p>

  <h2>🔧 My Role</h2>
  <p>I cleaned and merged Citi Bike and NOAA weather datasets, built visualizations in Streamlit, and embedded a Kepler map for spatial insights.</p>

  <h2>📊 Key Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🏙️ Identified busiest bike corridors across Manhattan and Brooklyn.</li>
    <li>📈 Found peak usage during May–October, with drops in winter months.</li>
    <li>🚲 Suggested 25–30% more bike stock in peak seasons.</li>
  </ul>
